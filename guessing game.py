# Now, we will make a game using loops. We will call this game a guessing game.
# In this game we take any number, let us suppose this number is number 5.
# After this we take any number as an input from the user between 1 to 10. The user tries to guess 
# this number.
# Suppose the user gives 3as an input. We will then check if 3 is equal to 5 or not?
# 3 is not equal to 5 so we will ask the user for another input.
# Now, we will check if that number is equal to 5 or not.
# User will get 5 chances to guess.
# If he guessed right within the 5 chances he wins and if he guesses wrong then loses the game.
# Hint :
# Study about break statement`` in python.

# i=1
# while i<=5:
#     num=int(input("enter the number:"))
#     if num==5:
#         print("congratulations!,you win!")
#         break
#     else:
#         print("you loss!")
#         print(5-i, "chance remain!")
#         print("try again!")
#     i+=1
