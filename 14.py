# ake an integer input in a variable named n. Take user input as many times as the value of n.

# Finally, print the sum of all those numbers which you have taken as an input.

# Example: If the user has put n value as 6, then take input for 6 times.

# Number of inputs to be taken?  6
# Enter a number > 10
# Enter a number > 1
# Enter a number > 56
# Enter a number > 89
# Enter a number > 11
# Enter a number > 12
# Sum: 179

i=1
sum=0
while i<=6:
  num=int(input("enter the number:"))
  sum=sum+num
  i+=1
print(sum)
